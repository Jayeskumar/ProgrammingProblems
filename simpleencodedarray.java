/*Maya has stored few confidential numbers in an array (array of int). To ensure that others do
not find the numbers easily, she has applied a simple encoding.
Encoding used: Each array element has been substituted with a value that is the difference of
its original value and its succeeding elementâ€™s value.
i.e. arr[i] = arr[i+1]-arr[i]
e.g. value in arr[0] = original value of arr[1] - original value of arr[0]
Also note that value of last element i.e. arr[last index] remains unchanged. */
